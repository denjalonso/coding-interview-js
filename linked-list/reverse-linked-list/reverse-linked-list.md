# Reverse a singly linked list

Excercise from coderust app.

## Description
Given the pointer/reference to the head of a singly linked list, resverse it and return the pointer/reference to the head of reversed linked list.

### Example

 Consider the following linked list:

 (head)
   |
  [7|.]->[14|.]->[21|.]->[28|.]->[null]

 Return the pointer to reversed linked list as shown in the figure.

 (head)
   |
  [28|.]->[21|.]->[14|.]->[7|.]->[null]

## Hints:
* How would you do it iteratively in a single pass?
* How would you do it recursively in a single pass?
